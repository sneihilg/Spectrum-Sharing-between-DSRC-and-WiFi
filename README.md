In this work, we investigate the coexistence of Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) and WiFi networks, in the 5.85-5.925 GHz band. The coexistence scenario is of interest as it considers networks that use a similar medium access mechanism (CSMA/CA) but have different objectives. While a DSRC network cares for the freshness of status updates and desires to minimize the age of received updates, a WiFi network would like to maximize throughput. We investigate a game theoretic approach to study the DSRC-WiFi coexistence problem.
